Components
==========

A. Utility versioner.Versioner implements IVersioner
It implements start_new_version and commit methods. These methods publish 
events before and after every operation, eg. BeforeObjectCommitEvent and 
AfterObjectCommitEvent.

It has accompanying methods for each operation, eg. can_checkout and
can_checkin.

B. browser.views.VersioningView
Every method in utility Versioner is exposed as a view, eg. method
can_start_new_version is @@upfront.versioning-can-start-new-version. This makes 
it possible to wire in versioning urls into portal_actions.

C. Adapter versioner.VersionMetadata implements IVersioner adapts IAttributeAnnotatable
It stores information about versioning as an annotation on an object. Adapting
an object exposes the information through properties.

All versioning information is provided by the annotation. No versioning information 
is inferred from an object's location in the site. The annotation stores the version 
number, the date the object was versioned, and a token which enables lookup of other 
versions of the object.

D. Persistent utility utilities.VersionSettings implements IVersioningSettings
It has a configlet as editing interface. The versionable_types list defines
which portal types can be versioned.

E. Catalog tool catalog.VersioningCatalog 
Indexes a token (for Archetypes content this is the UID), state (checked_in,
checked_out) and path of an object which has been handled by the Versioner
utility. It provides methods for retrieving versioning information for an
object: isCatalogued, getVersionsOf, getHighestVersionNumberOf

G. Event handlers
The event handlers subscribe to a subset of the events published by the
Versioner utility. 

These events 
    - Strip discussions from objects
    - Informs the user that the object contains references that will be
      lost on starting a new version. Archetypes by default does not preserve 
      references when an item is copied unless keepReferencesOnCopy is set 
      for a field in the schema.
      xxx: just thought of a way to handle this transparently !
    - Expires / un-expires objects

H. Viewlet browser.viewlets.versions.VersionsViewlet
A viewlet displaying versioning information below the object content. It is
loaded asynchronously.
